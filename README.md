# Basketball Team Stats Tool
In this project I wrote a program that reads from the "constants" data (`PLAYERS` and `TEAMS`) in `constants.py`.
This data was translated into a new collection and the fields were changed to something that makes more sense for Python to do its comparisons.

This app takes the constants given in constants.py, cleans it, and then splits players into 3 teams according to how experienced they are.
The user can then use this app to view the 3 teams and their stats.
